**Nostr** is my only social network, my npub is `npub180cvv07tjdrrgpa0j7j7tmnyl2yr6yr7l8j4s3evf6u64th6gkwsyjh6w6`.

my most recent open-source projects are more likely to be [published as NIP-34/Grasp repositories](https://viewsource.win/npub180cvv07tjdrrgpa0j7j7tmnyl2yr6yr7l8j4s3evf6u64th6gkwsyjh6w6) instead of on GitHub.

there is also a list of most of my Nostr-related apps and libraries at [stuff.fiatjaf.com](https://stuff.fiatjaf.com/).
